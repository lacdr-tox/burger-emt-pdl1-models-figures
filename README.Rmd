Models and code to generate figures for “Bidirectional Crosstalk Between Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity and IFNγ-Induced PD-L1 Expression Promotes Tumor Progression.” bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.03.478950 [@Burger2022_biorxiv].

## Usage

### Models

COPASI models can be found in `data/models`.

### Figures

Figures are generated reproducibly in R using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/):

1. Run 
    ```{r, eval=F}
renv::restore()
```
    to install R package dependencies.

2. Open `targets.Rmd` in RStudio and choose *Run* > *Run All*. Figures will appear in the `output` folder.
